This project had been created with `Google TypeScript Stype` becasue I like this easy to setup and nice to manage feature.

GTS initialization includes by default: 
 - eslint;
 - tsconfig;
 - prettier.

Use these comands in development:
 - lint: lint the project to find warnings and errors;
 - clean: to delete build;
 - compile: to build the project.
